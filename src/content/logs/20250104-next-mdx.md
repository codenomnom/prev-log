As our website has a lot of downloadable (pdf) legal documents, our team decided to use `md` for a content source.
That meant we'd need some library to parse and display that content on our static pages, looking the same as the pdf file.

For some reason [@next/md](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) is not fully compatible with our project - TS was complaining inside the Next config. The moment I've searched for issues and found [this one](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/74424) was the moment I decided I'd switch to something else.

I'm so tired of inconsitencies that I didn't even try to dig deeped. It took me less than a minute to install [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) and call it a day.
