As our website has a lot of downloadable (pdf) legal documents, our team decided to use `md` for a content source.
That meant we'd need some library to parse and display that content on our static pages, looking the same as the pdf file.

For some reason [@next/md](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) is not fully compatible with our project.
I'm so tired of inconsitencies that I didn't even try to dig deeped. I'd guess there are some peer dependency issues,
but it took me less than a minute to install [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) and call it a day.
